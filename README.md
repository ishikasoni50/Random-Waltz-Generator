# random-waltz-generator
Project for IAE 101 

In 1787, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart created a dice game (Mozart's Musikalisches WÃ¼rfelspiel). In the game, you compose a two-part waltz by pasting together 32 of 272 pre-composed musical elements at random.

The waltz consists of two parts - the minuet and the trio. Each is comprised of 16 measures, which are generated at random according to a fixed set of rules, as described below.

The minuet consists of 16 measures. There are 176 possible Minuet measures, named M1.wav through M176.wav. The trio consists of 16 measures. There are 96 possible Trio measures named T1.wav through T96.wav. (I did not upload the audio wave files)
